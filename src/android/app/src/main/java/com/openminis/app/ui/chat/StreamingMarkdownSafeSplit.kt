/**
 * [T-android-streaming-incremental-inline] Largest safe offset to split [text]
 * for incremental inline re-parse of a streaming tail. The result `p` satisfies:
 *   - `p` sits immediately AFTER a `\n` (so it lands on an inline-parse "reset"
 *     line boundary — inline code / `$…$` / `\(…\)` all stop at `\n`), and
 *   - `text[0, p)` has every multi-line-capable inline construct CLOSED, i.e.
 *     an even number of `**`, `__`, `~~`, `` ` `` runs and no dangling
 *     `[…](…` link, and no trailing `\` escape.
 *
 * This guarantees `parseInline(prefix) ++ parseInline(suffix) == parseInline(text)`
 * because no inline span crosses the split point. It's a single forward linear
 * scan (cheaper than the parse it saves). Returns 0 when no safe split exists
 * (caller then parses the whole thing) — conservative by construction: any
 * doubt about closure keeps the boundary earlier, never inside an open marker.
 *
 * We keep a [TAIL_MARGIN] of trailing chars unsplit so the still-growing tail
 * (where the model may still be mid-token, mid-`**`, mid-`$`) is always fully
 * re-scanned; only well-settled earlier content is frozen.
